# Agent customization and personalization

Golem emphasizes the importance of tailoring AI agent interactions to individual users and roles. This customization enhances user experience, productivity, and overall system effectiveness.

## User Preferences

Allow users to set preferences for agent behavior and communication style. This ensures interactions are comfortable and efficient for each user.

Example: Users can choose between detailed technical responses or high-level summaries, and set preferred notification methods (e.g., chat, email, or push notifications).

## Learning from Interactions

Agents should adapt their responses based on user feedback and historical interactions. This continuous learning improves the relevance and usefulness of agent assistance over time.

Example: If a user frequently asks for more details on specific metrics, the agent learns to proactively provide this information in future interactions.

## Role-Based Customization

Tailor agent capabilities to specific user roles, ensuring that each team member receives appropriate levels of information and support.

Example: Junior SREs might receive more explanatory information and guidance, while senior SREs get more concise data and advanced troubleshooting options.

## Customizable Dashboards

Let users configure which agents and information are prominently displayed in their interface. This allows each user to focus on the most relevant data for their responsibilities.

Example: A network specialist might prioritize network-related agents and metrics on their dashboard, while a database administrator focuses on database performance agents.

## Personalized Alerts

Adjust alert thresholds and formats based on individual user needs and preferences. This helps prevent alert fatigue and ensures critical information is communicated effectively.

Example: Users can set custom thresholds for different types of alerts, and choose how they want to be notified (e.g., color-coded severity levels or specific alert sounds).

By implementing these customization and personalization features, Golem ensures that AI agents in SRE platforms provide a tailored, efficient experience for each user, maximizing the effectiveness of human-AI collaboration in maintaining system reliability.
