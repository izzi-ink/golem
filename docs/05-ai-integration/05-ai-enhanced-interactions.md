# AI-enhanced interactions

Golem's design system leverages AI to create more intuitive, efficient, and valuable interactions for SRE teams. These guidelines outline how AI should enhance user interactions within the platform.

## Natural Language Processing

- Implement natural language understanding for user queries and commands
- Support conversational interfaces that allow users to interact in their own words
- Provide context-aware responses that understand the user's intent

Example: Allow users to ask, "What's causing the high latency in the payment service?" instead of navigating through multiple menus.

## Predictive Input

- Use AI to anticipate user needs and offer suggestions proactively
- Implement smart autocomplete for commands and queries
- Provide context-sensitive recommendations based on current system state

Example: As a user begins typing a command, suggest likely completions based on system status and recent activities.

## Intelligent Visualizations

- Use AI to generate dynamic, context-aware visualizations of complex data
- Automatically highlight anomalies or points of interest in charts and graphs
- Provide interactive elements that allow users to drill down into AI-generated insights

Example: When displaying a system performance dashboard, use AI to highlight unusual patterns and allow click-through for detailed analysis.

## Adaptive User Interfaces

- Dynamically adjust UI elements based on user behavior and preferences
- Use AI to prioritize and organize information based on relevance to current tasks
- Provide personalized shortcuts and tool suggestions based on usage patterns

Example: Reorganize dashboard widgets based on which metrics a user frequently monitors during their shift.

## Multimodal Interaction

- Support various input methods, including text, voice, and gestures
- Use AI to interpret and combine inputs from multiple modalities for more natural interaction
- Provide appropriate output formats (visual, audio, haptic) based on context and user preferences

Example: Allow users to combine voice commands with touch gestures to quickly navigate complex system architectures.

## Contextual Help and Guidance

- Provide AI-driven, context-sensitive help and documentation
- Offer step-by-step guidance for complex tasks, adapting to user actions in real-time
- Use AI to suggest relevant resources or training materials based on user activities

Example: When a user encounters an unfamiliar error, automatically offer relevant documentation and suggest potential next steps.

## Emotional Intelligence

- Implement basic emotional intelligence to detect user frustration or urgency
- Adapt interaction style and content based on the user's emotional state
- Provide empathetic responses and appropriate escalation options when needed

Example: If a user shows signs of frustration during a troubleshooting session, offer to connect them with human support or suggest a break.

By following these guidelines for AI-enhanced interactions, Golem ensures that its AI integration not only makes SRE tasks more efficient but also creates a more intuitive, responsive, and user-friendly experience for SRE teams.
