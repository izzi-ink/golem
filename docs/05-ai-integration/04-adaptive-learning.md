# Adaptive learning 

Golem's design system incorporates adaptive learning capabilities in its AI agents to ensure continuous improvement and personalization. These guidelines outline how AI agents should evolve based on interactions and feedback, enhancing their effectiveness over time.

## Continuous Feedback Loop

- Implement mechanisms to collect explicit and implicit feedback from users
- Use this feedback to refine AI models and improve response accuracy
- Regularly update AI knowledge bases with new information and best practices

Example: After each interaction, provide a quick, unobtrusive way for users to rate the AI's helpfulness.

## Personalized Interactions

- Adapt AI responses based on individual user preferences and behavior patterns
- Learn from past interactions to provide more relevant suggestions over time
- Allow users to see and modify their learned preferences

Example: If a user consistently prefers detailed technical explanations, the AI should automatically provide more in-depth responses.

## Context-Aware Learning

- Incorporate contextual information (e.g., time of day, system state) into learning processes
- Adapt recommendations based on the current operational context
- Recognize and respond to changing patterns in system behavior

Example: The Predictive Agent should learn to adjust its forecasts based on observed seasonal patterns in system load.

## Transparent Learning Process

- Clearly communicate to users how the AI is learning and adapting
- Provide insights into what the AI has learned and how it's applying that knowledge
- Allow users to reset or adjust the AI's learned behaviors if needed

Example: Include a "Learning Summary" in each AI agent's interface, showing recent adaptations and their impact.

## Balanced Adaptation

- Ensure that adaptive learning doesn't lead to overfitting or biased behavior
- Implement safeguards to prevent the AI from learning harmful or inefficient practices
- Regularly validate learned behaviors against established best practices

Example: Periodically review and validate the Remediation Agent's learned fix priorities against industry standards.

## Collaborative Learning

- Enable AI agents to share learned insights across the system securely
- Allow for knowledge transfer between different instances of the same agent type
- Implement mechanisms for human experts to review and approve significant learned changes

Example: When one Diagnostic Agent learns a new troubleshooting technique, it can share this with other Diagnostic Agents after human review.

By implementing these adaptive learning guidelines, Golem ensures that its AI integration becomes increasingly valuable over time, providing more personalized, context-aware, and effective assistance to SRE teams while maintaining transparency and control.
