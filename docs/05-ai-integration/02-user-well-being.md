# User well-being and privacy

Golem prioritizes user well-being and privacy in its AI integration for SRE platforms. These guidelines ensure that AI agents respect and protect user data while promoting a healthy work environment.

## Data Minimization

- Collect only essential data required for system operations
- Implement automatic data expiration and deletion policies
- Use anonymization and aggregation techniques where possible

Example: When logging user actions, store only necessary details like action type and timestamp, not personal identifiers.

## Transparent Data Usage

- Clearly communicate what data AI agents collect and how it's used
- Provide easily accessible privacy policies and data handling documentation
- Offer user-friendly interfaces for viewing and managing personal data

Example: Include a "Data Usage" section in each AI agent's interface, explaining its data requirements and processing methods.

## Consent and Control

- Implement clear opt-in mechanisms for AI features that use personal data
- Allow users to easily opt-out or modify their data sharing preferences
- Provide granular controls for different types of data and AI functionalities

Example: When enabling a new Predictive Agent feature, prompt users with a clear explanation and consent request.

## Secure Data Handling

- Encrypt all sensitive data in transit and at rest
- Implement strict access controls and authentication for AI systems
- Regularly audit and update security measures to protect against evolving threats

Example: Use end-to-end encryption for all communication between AI agents and user interfaces.

## Mental Health Considerations

- Design AI interactions to reduce stress and cognitive load
- Avoid overwhelming users with non-critical notifications
- Provide options for "quiet hours" or do-not-disturb periods

Example: Allow users to set preferences for alert frequency and urgency levels to prevent alert fatigue.

## Continuous Improvement

- Regularly solicit feedback on AI interactions and their impact on user well-being
- Monitor for unintended negative effects of AI assistance on user behavior or mental health
- Iterate on AI designs to enhance user comfort and trust

Example: Conduct periodic surveys to assess how AI integration affects SRE team stress levels and job satisfaction.

By adhering to these guidelines, Golem ensures that its AI integration not only respects user privacy but also actively contributes to a positive and healthy work environment for SRE teams.
