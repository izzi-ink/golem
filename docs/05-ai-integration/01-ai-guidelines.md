# Ethical AI guidelines

Golem's design system prioritizes ethical AI integration in SRE platforms. These guidelines ensure that AI agents operate responsibly, transparently, and in alignment with human values.

## User Well-being and Privacy

- Prioritize user data protection and privacy in all AI operations
- Implement data minimization principles, collecting only necessary information
- Ensure secure storage and transmission of sensitive data
- Provide clear opt-in/opt-out mechanisms for data collection and AI assistance

Example: AI agents should anonymize personal data in logs and alerts, focusing on system-level information.

## Human Agency and Control

- Design AI to augment human decision-making, not replace it
- Provide clear mechanisms for users to override AI decisions
- Ensure that critical actions always require human approval
- Maintain an appropriate balance between automation and manual control

Example: When a Remediation Agent suggests a fix, it should present options and await human confirmation before implementation.

## Transparency and Explainability

- Make AI decision-making processes transparent and understandable
- Provide clear explanations for AI recommendations and actions
- Use visualizations and plain language to communicate complex AI insights
- Maintain detailed logs of AI activities for auditing purposes

Example: A Diagnostic Agent should explain its reasoning process when identifying a root cause, not just present the conclusion.

## Fairness and Non-discrimination

- Regularly audit AI systems for bias in decision-making
- Ensure AI training data is diverse and representative
- Implement safeguards against reinforcing or amplifying existing biases
- Provide equal quality of service to all users regardless of their characteristics

Example: Ensure that the Predictive Agent's resource allocation suggestions don't unfairly prioritize certain services or teams.

## Continuous Improvement and Oversight

- Establish mechanisms for ongoing evaluation of AI performance and ethics
- Encourage user feedback on AI interactions and incorporate it into improvements
- Maintain human oversight of AI systems, especially for critical operations
- Regularly update AI models and algorithms to address emerging ethical concerns

Example: Implement a regular review process where SRE teams can flag and discuss any ethical concerns about AI agent behavior.

By adhering to these ethical AI guidelines, Golem ensures that its AI integration enhances SRE practices while maintaining trust, safety, and human-centric values.
