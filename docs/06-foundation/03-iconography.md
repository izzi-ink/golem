# Iconography

Golem's iconography aim to leverage AI capabilities to enhance the effectiveness of iconography in SRE systems, potentially improving at-a-glance understanding and quicker issue identification.

1. Adaptive icons: Icons that dynamically change based on system status, becoming more detailed or urgent as issues escalate.

2. AI-generated icons: Create custom icons on-the-fly to represent complex system states or unique error conditions.

3. Predictive status icons: Icons that not only show current state but hint at predicted future states based on AI analysis.

4. Severity-scaled icons: Automatically resize icons based on the AI's assessment of issue severity.

5. Context-aware tooltips: Icons with AI-powered tooltips that provide relevant, real-time information when hovered over.

6. Trend-indicating animations: Subtle animations in icons to show if a metric is trending up, down, or stable.

7. Multi-state icons: Icons that can represent multiple states simultaneously, useful for complex system dependencies.

8. AI-curated icon sets: Dynamically select the most appropriate icon set based on the current user's role and task.

9. Anomaly-highlighting icons: Special icons or icon states to draw attention to anomalies detected by AI.

10. Time-aware icons: Icons that visually indicate how long a particular state has been active.

11. Machine learning-based icon placement: Optimize the dashboard layout by intelligently placing icons where they're most likely to be needed.

12. Interconnected icon systems: Icons that visually link to show relationships between different system components or issues.
