# Motion and animation

Golem's kinetic guidelines aim to create a motion and animation system that enhances the user experience of the SRE platform, improves information comprehension, and effectively leverages AI capabilities while maintaining a professional and focused environment.

1. Purpose-driven animation: Use motion to convey meaning, such as indicating state changes or drawing attention to critical updates.

2. Subtle feedback: Implement subtle animations for user interactions to provide immediate visual feedback.

3. Performance indicators: Use animation to represent system performance trends, like smoothly updating graphs or progress bars.

4. Consistent timing: Establish a standard set of animation durations (e.g., 200ms for quick transitions, 300-500ms for more noticeable changes).

5. Easing functions: Use appropriate easing functions to make animations feel natural and not abrupt.

6. AI-triggered animations: Allow the AI to initiate animations to highlight important changes or potential issues.

7. Load states: Design smooth loading animations that inform users about background processes or data retrieval.

8. Transitions between views: Use fluid transitions when switching between different dashboard views or levels of detail.

9. Directional cues: Use motion to provide directional cues, helping users understand where new information is coming from or where actions will lead.

10. Reduce motion option: Provide an option to reduce or turn off non-essential animations for users who prefer less motion or have vestibular disorders.

11. Contextual speed: Adjust animation speed based on the urgency of the information (e.g., faster for critical alerts).

12. Visualizing AI processes: Use subtle animations to represent ongoing AI processes, providing transparency about system activities.
