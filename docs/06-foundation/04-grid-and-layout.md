# Grid and layout

Golem's guidelines aim to create a flexible, AI-enhanced layout system that can effectively present complex SRE data while maintaining usability and visual coherence.

1. Responsive grid system: Use a flexible grid that adapts to different screen sizes and resolutions, ensuring consistency across devices.

2. AI-driven layout prioritization: Allow the AI to dynamically adjust the layout based on current system status and user needs.

3. Modular components: Design layout components that can be easily rearranged or scaled by the AI as needed.

4. Consistent spacing: Implement a standardized spacing system to maintain visual harmony and improve readability.

5. Hierarchy-based layouts: Use layout to establish clear visual hierarchies, helping users quickly identify critical information.

6. Contextual density: Allow AI to adjust the density of information displayed based on the current situation and user preferences.

7. Asymmetrical balance: Embrace asymmetrical layouts when appropriate to draw attention to key areas identified by the AI.

8. Negative space utilization: Use white space effectively to improve focus and reduce cognitive load, especially during critical events.

9. Scalable layouts: Ensure layouts can accommodate varying amounts of data without breaking the overall design.

10. Consistent alignment: Maintain consistent alignment principles across all components for a cohesive look.

11. Flexible zoning: Define clear zones for different types of information (e.g., alerts, metrics, logs) that can be dynamically resized by the AI.

12. Accessibility considerations: Ensure layouts support accessibility standards and can adapt to user-specific needs.
