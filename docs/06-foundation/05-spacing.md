# Spacing

These guidelines aim to create a flexible yet consistent spacing system that enhances readability and usability while allowing for AI-driven adaptations in the SRE platform interface.

1. Consistent scale: Use a consistent spacing scale (e.g., 4px, 8px, 16px, 32px) throughout the interface for visual harmony.

2. Contextual spacing: Allow AI to adjust spacing dynamically based on the importance and relationships of elements.

3. Breathing room: Ensure adequate white space around critical information to improve focus and readability.

4. Compact mode: Provide an AI-triggered compact spacing mode for high-density information display during critical events.

5. Grouping: Use consistent spacing to visually group related elements and separate distinct sections.

6. Responsive spacing: Adjust spacing based on screen size and resolution to maintain readability across devices.

7. Hierarchy enhancement: Use varying spacing to reinforce information hierarchy and guide user attention.

8. Grid alignment: Align spacing to the underlying grid system for a cohesive layout.

9. Component-specific rules: Define clear spacing rules for recurring UI components (e.g., cards, tables, alerts).

10. Accessibility compliance: Ensure spacing adheres to accessibility guidelines, particularly for interactive elements.

11. Dynamic padding: Allow AI to adjust padding within components based on content priority and user interaction patterns.

12. Consistency in animation: Maintain consistent spacing when elements are animated or repositioned by the AI.
