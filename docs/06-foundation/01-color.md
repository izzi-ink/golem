# Color

## AI State Indication

Rule: Use consistent color coding to indicate AI activity states.

- Blue: AI listening or processing
- Green: AI task completed successfully
- Yellow: AI requires user input or clarification
- Red: AI encountered an error or critical issue

## Confidence Level Representation

Rule: Use color saturation to represent AI confidence levels.

- Higher saturation: Higher confidence
- Lower saturation: Lower confidence

## Data Freshness

Rule: Use color gradients to indicate data recency.

- Vibrant colors: Most recent data
- Faded colors: Older data

## Anomaly Highlighting

Rule: Use contrasting colors to highlight anomalies or outliers detected by AI.

- Example: Bright orange for anomalies against a neutral background

## Predictive Indicators

Rule: Use a specific color palette for AI predictions and forecasts.

- Example: Shades of purple for predicted future states

## Accessibility

Rule: Ensure all color choices meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards for contrast and readability.

## Color Constancy

Rule: Maintain consistent color meanings across different components and contexts.

## Adaptive Color Schemes

Rule: Provide both light and dark modes, with AI automatically suggesting the optimal mode based on environmental factors and user preferences.

## Severity Scaling

Rule: Use a consistent color scale to represent severity levels in alerts or issues.

- Example: Green (low) -> Yellow -> Orange -> Red (high)

## Action Suggestions

Rule: Use a distinct color (e.g., teal) to highlight AI-suggested actions or recommendations.

These color rules aim to enhance usability, consistency, and intuitiveness in AI-driven interfaces within the Golem design system.
