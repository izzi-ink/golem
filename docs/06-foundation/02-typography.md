# Typography

Golem aim to leverage AI capabilities to enhance the effectiveness of typography in SRE systems, potentially improving user experience and system reliability management. This is done through the following key guidelines.

## Dynamic font sizing
AI could adjust font sizes based on the importance of information, making critical alerts larger and more noticeable.

## Sentiment-based styling

Use different fonts or styles to convey the sentiment of AI-generated insights (e.g., urgent issues vs. positive trends).

## Readability optimization

AI could analyze the dashboard's content and user's viewing habits to optimize typography for maximum readability.

## Context-aware typefaces

Switch between different typefaces based on the type of data being displayed (e.g., logs, metrics, alerts).

## AI-driven emphasis

Automatically bold or italicize key terms or metrics that the AI determines are most relevant to current system state.

## Adaptive line length

Adjust text width based on content complexity and user reading speed to optimize comprehension.

## Intelligent truncation

Use AI to smartly truncate long text while preserving the most critical information.

## Temporal typography

Subtly animate or pulse text to indicate how recent the information is.

## Cognitive load balancing

Adjust typography density based on the user's current cognitive load and system complexity.

## Culturally adaptive fonts

If the system is used globally, AI could select appropriate fonts based on the user's language and cultural context.

## Error-highlighting typography

Use distinct typography styles to highlight potential errors or inconsistencies in log data.

## Focus-driven scaling

Dynamically adjust the scale of typography elements based on where the AI predicts the user needs to focus.
