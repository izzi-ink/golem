# Where do I start?

To start implementing the Golem design system for your system, I recommend beginning with these key steps:

## Core principles: 
Familiarize yourself with Golem's ethical AI guidelines and user-centric approach. These should inform all design decisions.

## SRE dashboard basics: 
Start with essential elements like status overview panels, time series graphs, and alert lists. Focus on making these AI-enhanced and context-aware.

## User research: 
Understand your team's specific needs and pain points to guide your implementation.

## Identify AI touchpoints: 
Determine where AI can add the most value in your enterprise system workflows, such as in anomaly detection or predictive alerting.

## Implement key interaction patterns: 
Begin with critical interactions like natural language querying for system data or AI-guided troubleshooting.

## Design for transparency:
Ensure users understand when and how AI is assisting them in the interface.

## Start small and iterate: 
Begin with a few core components and gather user feedback to refine and expand the system gradually.

Remember, the goal is to create an intuitive, AI-enhanced interface that supports enterprise systems in maintaining system reliability more effectively.
