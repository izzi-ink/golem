# What makes Golem different?

Golem differs from other design systems in a few key ways:

## AI-first approach: 
Golem is specifically designed for embedding AI into user interfaces and interactions, rather than being a general-purpose design system.

## Ethical foundation: 
It's built on principles inspired by Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics, prioritizing user well-being, privacy, and human agency in all AI interactions.

## Adaptive learning: 
Golem components are designed to improve over time based on user interactions, while maintaining ethical boundaries.

## Contextual awareness: 
The system emphasizes AI that understands and responds to the user's current task, past behavior, and overall context.

## Proactive assistance: 
Instead of just responding to user actions, Golem aims to anticipate needs and offer suggestions preemptively.

## SRE focus: 
Golem is tailored for Site Reliability Engineering, with features like AI-driven anomaly detection, predictive insights, and dynamic service dependency mapping.

## Natural language integration: 
The system supports natural language processing for more intuitive user interactions with complex systems.

## Transparency: 
Golem emphasizes making AI decision-making processes clear to users, helping to build trust and understanding.

By combining these elements, Golem aims to create more intelligent, ethical, and user-centric AI-embedded interfaces specifically for SRE platforms.
