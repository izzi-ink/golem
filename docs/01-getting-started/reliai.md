# What is ReliAI?

ReliAI is a hypothetical Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) platform. It's the system that would use Golem as its design system.

Golem is the actual design system being developed for embedding AI into user interfaces, with a focus on SRE applications but potentially usable in other domains as well.

To summarize the key differences:

1. Purpose:
   - ReliAI: An SRE platform for managing and monitoring system reliability
   - Golem: A design system for creating AI-enhanced user interfaces

2. Scope:
   - ReliAI: A specific application or platform
   - Golem: A set of design principles, components, and patterns that can be applied to multiple projects

3. Relationship:
   - ReliAI would implement Golem to create its user interface and interactions
   - Golem provides the guidelines and components that ReliAI (and potentially other systems) would use

So while they are closely related, they are distinct entities. Golem is the broader, reusable design system, while ReliAI would be a specific implementation using Golem's principles and components.
