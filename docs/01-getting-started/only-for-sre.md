# Is Golem only for SREs?

While Golem was initially designed with a focus on SRE platforms, its core principles and approaches are applicable to a wide range of systems that involve human-AI interaction. Here's how:

## Adaptable principles: 
Golem's ethical AI guidelines and user-centric approach are valuable for any AI-embedded system.

## Versatile interaction patterns: 
Voice interactions, predictive interfaces, and natural language processing can benefit many types of applications.

## Flexible visual components: 
Adaptive layouts and AI-enhanced data visualizations are useful across various domains.

## Universal feedback mechanisms: 
Error prevention, proactive assistance, and user feedback loops are important in any interactive system.

## Broad personalization potential:
User preference learning and contextual awareness can enhance user experiences in diverse applications.

When adapting Golem for non-SRE systems, focus on the core principles and adapt the specific components and interactions to fit your domain's needs. The key is maintaining the emphasis on ethical AI, user control, and adaptive learning while tailoring the implementation to your specific use case.
