# Forms and inputs

These guidelines aim to create a transparent, efficient, and user-centric input system that clearly delineates between standard system operations, human interactions, and AI assistance, enhancing trust and usability in the SRE platform.

1. Clear agent identification: Visually distinguish between standard system forms, human-managed inputs, and AI-assisted forms. Use consistent color coding, icons, or labels to indicate the type of agent involved.

2. Transparent AI involvement: When AI is assisting with form completion or processing, clearly communicate this to the user through a visible indicator or label.

3. Adaptive input fields: Allow AI to dynamically adjust form fields based on context, but always indicate when this occurs.

4. Intelligent defaults: Use AI to provide smart default values, but visually highlight these suggestions so users know they're AI-generated.

5. Real-time validation: Implement AI-powered real-time validation, clearly differentiating between system rules and AI-based suggestions.

6. Explainable AI assistance: Provide easily accessible explanations for any AI-driven form behavior or suggestions.

7. Human override options: Always allow users to override AI suggestions, with clear controls to revert to manual input.

8. Consistent styling: Maintain a consistent visual style for all form elements, with subtle variations to indicate AI involvement.

9. Progress indicators: For complex forms, use progress indicators that show both system and AI-assisted steps.

10. Error handling: Clearly distinguish between system-generated errors and AI-detected potential issues.

11. Data source transparency: When forms are pre-filled, indicate whether the data comes from the system, human input, or AI prediction.

12. Feedback mechanisms: Include options for users to provide feedback on AI performance in form interactions.
