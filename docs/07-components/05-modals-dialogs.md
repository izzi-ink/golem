# Modals and Dialogs

These guidelines aim to create intelligent, context-aware modal and dialog elements that enhance user efficiency in SRE tasks while maintaining transparency about AI involvement.

1. AI interaction indicator: Use a consistent visual cue (e.g., specific icon or color) to clearly indicate when a modal or dialog is an AI interaction.

2. Data usage transparency: Include a clear, concise statement at the bottom of AI-specific modals explaining if and how the interaction data will be used for AI training.

3. Opt-out option: Provide an easily accessible option within AI-specific dialogs to opt-out of data collection for AI training purposes.

4. Interaction type header: Clearly label the top of each modal or dialog with "AI Interaction", "System Notification", or "Human Support" to set clear expectations.

5. AI confidence level: For AI-generated content in modals, display a confidence level indicator to help users gauge the reliability of the information.

6. Feedback for AI improvement: In AI-specific dialogs, include a quick feedback mechanism (e.g., thumbs up/down) to help improve AI performance.

7. Human escalation option: For AI interactions, provide a clear option to escalate to human support if needed.

8. AI vs system actions: Visually differentiate between actions that will be performed by AI and those that are standard system operations.

9. Data retention notice: For interactions that will be used for AI training, provide a brief data retention notice with a link to more detailed information.

10. Consent confirmation: For first-time AI interactions or when data usage policies change, use a modal to obtain explicit user consent.

11. AI learning mode indicator: Use a subtle visual cue to indicate when the AI is in active learning mode during the interaction.

12. Source attribution: Clearly indicate whether the information in the modal is AI-generated, from the system database, or human-provided.
