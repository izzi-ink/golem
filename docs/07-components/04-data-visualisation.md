# Data visualisation

These guidelines focus on making complex SRE data more accessible and actionable, leveraging AI to enhance system reliability monitoring and incident response.

1. Real-Time Adaptive Visualizations:
   - Support dynamic updates reflecting AI-processed data streams
   - Allow customizable dashboards for monitoring key SRE metrics

2. Interactive Exploration:
   - Enable drill-down capabilities for detailed system analysis
   - Provide AI-guided exploratory tools for anomaly investigation

3. Explainable AI Visuals:
   - Incorporate decision path visualizations for AI-driven alerts
   - Display confidence intervals for predictive maintenance insights

4. Context-Aware Presentations:
   - Tailor visualizations to user roles (e.g., on-call engineer vs. manager)
   - Adapt complexity based on user expertise and current system state

5. Automated Narrative Elements:
   - Include AI-generated annotations highlighting critical system events
   - Provide succinct summaries of complex incident timelines

6. Multi-Dimensional Data Representation:
   - Use 3D visualizations for complex service dependencies
   - Integrate cross-modal data (logs, metrics, traces) in unified views

7. Predictive and Proactive Visuals:
   - Show AI-projected trends for resource utilization and service health
   - Enable scenario simulations for capacity planning

8. Scalable and Modular Components:
   - Ensure visualizations handle varying data scales efficiently
   - Design reusable components for consistent incident reporting

9. Bias and Fairness Indicators:
   - Visualize potential biases in AI-driven alert systems
   - Provide tools for auditing fairness in incident response times

10. User Feedback Integration:
    - Allow annotation of false positives/negatives in anomaly detection
    - Enable customization of alert visualization preferences

11. Cross-Platform Consistency:
    - Ensure responsive design for on-call mobile access
    - Maintain consistent visual language across monitoring tools

12. Performance Monitoring:
    - Visualize AI model performance in detecting system anomalies
    - Highlight data quality issues affecting reliability predictions
