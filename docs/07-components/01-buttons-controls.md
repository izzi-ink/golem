# Buttons and controls

While there are no explicit guidelines for buttons and controls in the provided Golem design system information, We ffer some appropriate recommendations based on SRE and AI integration needs.

These guidelines aim to create intuitive, efficient, and AI-enhanced controls for the ReliAI SRE platform while maintaining consistency and usability.

1. Consistent styling: Use a uniform style for buttons and controls across the platform to maintain visual coherence.

2. Clear affordances: Ensure buttons and controls have clear visual cues indicating they are interactive elements.

3. State indicators: Incorporate visual feedback for different states (hover, active, disabled) to improve usability.

4. AI-enhanced tooltips: Implement smart tooltips that provide context-aware information when hovering over controls.

5. Hierarchy: Use visual hierarchy (size, color, placement) to indicate the importance of different actions.

6. Adaptive controls: Allow AI to dynamically show, hide, or modify controls based on current system state and user needs.

7. Contextual actions: Group related controls together and use AI to suggest relevant actions based on current context.

8. Error prevention: Implement confirmation steps for critical actions, with AI-driven warnings when necessary.

9. Accessibility: Ensure all controls are keyboard accessible and work well with screen readers.

10. Responsive sizing: Design controls that scale appropriately across different device sizes and resolutions.

11. AI-driven defaults: Use AI to pre-select optimal default settings for complex controls based on system analysis.

12. Progressive disclosure: Implement a system of progressive disclosure for advanced controls, revealed as needed.
