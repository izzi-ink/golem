# Natural language processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) in a design system for embedded AI, particularly for SRE applications like Golem, feature some unique characteristics.

These guidelines ensure that NLP in the Golem Design System is optimized for SRE needs, enhancing efficiency while maintaining clarity and reliability in AI-human interactions.

1. Domain-specific understanding: Tailor NLP to comprehend SRE-specific terminology, acronyms, and jargon.

2. Context-aware interpretation: Enable NLP to understand queries in the context of current system state and ongoing incidents.

3. Intent recognition: Develop ability to discern between informational queries, action requests, and alert acknowledgments.

4. Multi-turn conversations: Support complex dialogues for troubleshooting and incident management.

5. Query expansion: Automatically expand terse engineer inputs into more comprehensive system queries.

6. Ambiguity resolution: Implement clarification dialogues for ambiguous requests, critical in high-stakes SRE environments.

7. Tone analysis: Detect urgency or stress in language to prioritize responses accordingly.

8. Multilingual support: Accommodate global SRE teams with real-time translation and understanding.

9. Code and log parsing: Integrate ability to process and understand code snippets and log formats within natural language.

10. Query-to-action mapping: Translate natural language inputs directly into system actions or API calls.

11. Continuous learning: Adapt to team-specific language patterns and new technologies over time.

12. Explainable NLP: Provide transparency in how AI interprets and acts on natural language inputs.

13. Privacy-aware processing: Clearly indicate when and how natural language inputs are used for AI training.

14. Fallback mechanisms: Gracefully handle situations where NLP fails to understand, especially during critical operations.
