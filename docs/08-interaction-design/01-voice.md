# Voice interaction

These guidelines focus on creating an efficient, secure, and user-friendly voice interaction system specifically designed for SRE tasks and embedded AI capabilities in the Golem Design System.

1. Context-aware commands: Enable AI to interpret voice commands with understanding of current system state and user role.

2. Adaptive responses: Adjust tone and content based on urgency of SRE situations and user expertise.

3. Proactive notifications: Allow AI to initiate voice alerts for critical system events or predicted issues.

4. Multi-modal integration: Ensure seamless transition between voice and visual interfaces for complex SRE tasks.

5. Complex task management: Support multi-step voice commands for incident response procedures.

6. Error handling: Provide clear feedback and alternatives when AI misinterprets commands during critical operations.

7. Continuous learning: Implement voice-based feedback mechanisms to improve AI's understanding of SRE terminology and commands.

8. Security controls: Use voice biometrics for authentication and include voice commands for managing access levels.

9. Accessibility: Ensure support for diverse speech patterns and accents among global SRE teams.

10. Minimal cognitive load: Design concise voice interactions to avoid overwhelming engineers during high-stress scenarios.

11. Environment awareness: Adapt voice interactions based on the operational environment (e.g., data center, remote work).

12. Emotion recognition: Adjust AI responses based on detected stress levels during incident management.

13. AI interaction indicator: Clearly state when the voice interface is engaging the AI system versus standard operations.

14. Data usage transparency: Verbally inform users when voice interactions will be used for AI training, with opt-out options.
