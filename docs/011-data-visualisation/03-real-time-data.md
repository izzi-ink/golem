# Real-time data handling

Real-time data handling in Golem for SRE platforms would uniquely focus on:

1. Adaptive refresh rates: Automatically adjust update frequencies based on data volatility and system criticality.

2. Predictive buffering: Use AI to anticipate and pre-load likely data changes for smoother visualizations.

3. Intelligent aggregation: Dynamically summarize high-volume data streams without losing critical details.

4. Anomaly-triggered zooming: Automatically focus on metrics showing unusual activity in real-time.

5. Contextual data retention: Selectively preserve historical data points based on their significance to current system state.

6. Proactive alert visualization: Integrate predictive alerts directly into real-time charts before issues occur.

7. Cross-metric correlation: Instantly highlight relationships between different real-time data streams.

8. Automated triage visuals: Prioritize and visually emphasize metrics requiring immediate attention.

9. Scalable rendering: Efficiently handle and display massive real-time datasets without performance degradation.

10. AI-guided exploration: Provide intelligent suggestions for relevant metrics to monitor based on current system behavior.

These features would make Golem's real-time data handling more efficient, insightful, and actionable for SRE needs.
