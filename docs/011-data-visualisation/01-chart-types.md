# Chart types

In the context of Golem, a design system for embedded AI in SRE platforms, chart types would be uniquely tailored to:

1. Adapt dynamically: AI-driven charts that automatically adjust their type based on the data and user context.

2. Predictive overlays: Incorporate AI-generated forecasts and anomaly predictions directly into standard charts.

3. Intelligent aggregation: Automatically summarize complex data sets, showing the most relevant metrics for current system state.

4. Interactive drill-downs: Allow users to explore deeper layers of data through AI-guided interactions.

5. Correlation highlighting: Automatically identify and visualize relationships between different metrics and events.

6. Real-time updates: Seamlessly incorporate live data streams, adjusting chart scales and focus areas as needed.

7. Role-based views: Customize chart complexity and detail based on the user's role and expertise level.

8. Automated annotations: AI-generated explanations and insights overlaid directly on charts.

9. Multi-dimensional visualizations: Present complex system relationships in intuitive, interactive 3D or nested charts.

10. Contextual comparisons: Dynamically include relevant historical or benchmark data for context.

These features would make Golem's chart types more intelligent, adaptive, and insightful for SRE needs.
