# AI-enhanced data representations

AI-enhanced data representation in Golem for SRE platforms would uniquely focus on:

1. Anomaly highlighting: Automatically emphasize unusual patterns or outliers in system performance data.

2. Predictive visualizations: Show potential future states or failure points based on current trends.

3. Root cause analysis: Visually link related metrics to help identify underlying issues quickly.

4. Adaptive thresholds: Dynamically adjust and display warning thresholds based on historical and real-time data.

5. Intelligent data reduction: Automatically simplify complex datasets while preserving critical information.

6. Context-aware focus: Highlight the most relevant metrics based on current system state or ongoing incidents.

7. Auto-generated narratives: Provide AI-written summaries alongside visualizations to explain key insights.

8. Comparative benchmarking: Automatically overlay industry or historical benchmarks for context.

9. Interactive "what-if" scenarios: Allow users to visualize potential outcomes of different actions.

10. Unified service views: Intelligently combine multiple data sources to present holistic service health visualizations.

These features would make Golem's data representations more insightful, proactive, and tailored to SRE needs.
