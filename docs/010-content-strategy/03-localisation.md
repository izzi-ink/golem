# Localization and internationalization

These principles will help Golem create a culturally sensitive and globally accessible AI experience within the ReliAI platform.

1. Dynamic language adaptation: Enable real-time language switching based on user preferences.

2. Cultural sensitivity: Adapt content, examples, and visuals to align with local customs and practices.

3. Multilingual support: Handle a wide range of languages, dialects, and mixed-language inputs.

4. Region-specific content: Generate content using local references, currency, and measurements.

5. Flexible UI components: Design interface elements that adapt to different languages and cultural contexts.

6. Cultural norms in AI interactions: Adjust communication style to match local expectations (e.g., formality, directness).

7. Localized content validation: Implement processes to test and validate AI-generated content for cultural appropriateness.

8. Scalable localization framework: Build a system that easily expands to new languages and regions.

9. Local data integration: Connect with region-specific data sources and services for relevant information.

10. Dialect and accent support: Recognize and accurately interpret local speech variations in voice interactions.

11. Continuous improvement: Learn from localized user interactions to enhance language models and cultural understanding.

12. Accessibility across locales: Ensure localization efforts consider regional accessibility needs and technologies.
