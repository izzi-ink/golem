# Enhancing Golem: Applying Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics to Embedded AI Design

In our ongoing development of Golem, our innovative design system for embedded AI, we're constantly seeking ways to improve user experience. Today, we're excited to explore how Jakob Nielsen's renowned 10 Usability Heuristics can be adapted and applied to AI-human interactions within the Golem framework.

## 1. Visibility of System Status

In Golem: AI components must always keep users informed about what is happening, providing appropriate feedback within reasonable time.

- Example: A voice assistant clearly indicates when it's listening, processing, or ready for input through visual and audio cues.

## 2. Match Between System and the Real World

In Golem: AI interactions should speak the users' language, with words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms.

- Example: A smart home AI uses natural language processing to understand and respond to colloquial commands like "make it a bit warmer" instead of requiring specific temperature inputs.

## 3. User Control and Freedom

In Golem: Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue.

- Example: An AI-powered email system allows easy undoing of automated email categorization or scheduling actions.

## 4. Consistency and Standards

In Golem: AI components should follow platform conventions and maintain consistency across different applications and devices.

- Example: Gesture controls for AI interfaces remain consistent across different smart devices in a household.

## 5. Error Prevention

In Golem: Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.

- Example: An AI writing assistant warns users before sending emails with potential sensitive content or missing attachments.

## 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall

In Golem: Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another.

- Example: An AI shopping assistant remembers and suggests previously bought items or frequently searched categories.

## 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use

In Golem: Accelerators – unseen by the novice user – may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users.

- Example: A smart calendar AI learns user preferences over time, offering increasingly personalized scheduling suggestions.

## 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

In Golem: Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.

- Example: A virtual assistant provides concise, relevant responses, with an option to request more detailed information if needed.

## 9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors

In Golem: Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.

- Example: When an AI-powered smart car system detects a potential issue, it provides a clear explanation and suggests next steps, such as "Low tire pressure detected in front left tire. Would you like directions to the nearest service station?"

## 10. Help and Documentation

In Golem: Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.

- Example: An AI chatbot is always available to provide context-sensitive help, explaining features and guiding users through complex tasks step-by-step.

By integrating these heuristics into the Golem design system, we aim to create embedded AI experiences that are not only powerful and ethical but also intuitive and user-friendly. As we continue to refine Golem, these principles will serve as a valuable checklist, ensuring that our AI interactions consistently prioritize usability and user satisfaction.

In our next post, we'll explore real-world case studies of how these heuristics have been successfully implemented in Golem-based AI systems. Stay tuned!
